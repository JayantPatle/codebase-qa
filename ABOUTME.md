### Why I Built Codebase Q&A

This project was created to demonstrate:
1. Full-stack development capabilities
2. Modern architecture patterns (REST API, SPA)
3. AI/LLM integration in real applications
4. DevOps and containerization knowledge
5. Strong attention to documentation and code quality
6. Ability to take a project from concept to production

### Philosophy

- **Code Quality First:** Clean, maintainable code over clever hacks
- **User Experience Matters:** Simple interfaces with powerful features
- **Documentation is King:** READMEs, comments, and examples for future maintainers
- **Test Early:** Catch bugs before production
- **Continuous Improvement:** Always learning and iterating

### Fun Facts

- Built my first web app in 2015 (jQuery + PHP)
- Have deployed 20+ projects to production
- Coffee enthusiast ☕
- Enjoy hiking and contributing to open source
- Can debug anything with enough Stack Overflow and patience 😄
